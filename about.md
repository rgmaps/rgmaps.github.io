This is perpetually in progress but I want to start with something

My name is Randy, I'm interested in topics on mapping especially when it's at the intersection of CAD and GIS. I spend most of my day trying to solve that problem. I spend the rest of the time hanging out with my family, it never feels like enough, life is way too short. This is just another thing I want to try and keep up with. Hopefully I can figure out what I am doing here.
