I have taken a fascination the US Naval Reserve Fleet. I've mostly been looking at the one at Suisan Bay, CA but all the ships have apparently been removed and scrapped. It is just one of those interesting things that I enjoy taking a deep dive into. The promise of the reserve fleet is that these ships can be reactivated in as little as 10 days. Based on the photos I have seen, that goal seems tight. Most of these ships appear unable to move on their own power. Business Insider has a great article on the fleet [BI: Reserve Fleet](http://www.businessinsider.com/mothball-fleet-of-decaying-ships-off-coast-of-san-francisco-2014-10). All the photos are taken from [Amy Heiden](http://amyheiden.com/suisun-bay-mothball-fleet/) who has a great collection of images from the fleet.

The reserve fleet has taken me on a large run through various Wikipedia article. A fun but time consuming venture.
