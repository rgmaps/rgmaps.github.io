# Responsive map + list template
HTML template for an application with a map and corresponding list which, on smaller screens, lets user scroll between the two views. Inspired by google maps mobile app.

It uses CSS grid, for which browser support is pretty darn good these days. The only JavaScript is used for making the "toggle" button work, but you can also just scroll with your mouse, which doesn't require any JavaScript.

## usage
Just open `index.html` in your browser, or run a static web server.
